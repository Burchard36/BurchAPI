When contributing to BurchAPI, any methods you create and/or modify MUST have a JavaDoc attatched to it.

When you are ready to commit, make sure you run `mac clean package`. This generates any javadoc's that you added/changed into the /docs folder.

You may NOT manually edit any javadoc website folder, any PR's with files in /docs that seem to be manually edited will be closed
